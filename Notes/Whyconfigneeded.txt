Awesome observation — you're thinking critically! Let's clarify this.

---

### ✅ You're absolutely right to ask:

> Didn't we already handle authentication in the `AuthController` and `AuthService`? Why are we doing it **again** in `SecurityConfig`?

### 🧠 Short Answer:

* **`AuthService` and `AuthController` handle the logic of login/register.**
* **`SecurityConfig` tells Spring Security which URLs should be protected or open.**

They are **not doing the same thing**, but they **work together**.

---

### 🧩 Here's the difference:

| Part                             | What it does                                     | Example                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthController` + `AuthService` | Handle login, signup, and JWT generation logic   | `"Take user input → check password → give JWT"`                      |
| `SecurityConfig`                 | Tells Spring which routes need a token to access | `"Allow /login without token, block /profile unless token is valid"` |

---

### 🔁 Why both are needed?

#### Imagine this flow:

1. **User logs in** at `/api/auth/login`

   * Handled by `AuthController` → calls `AuthService.login()` → returns JWT.

2. **User sends token** to access `/api/profile`

   * Now **Spring Security** needs to decide:

     * Is `/api/profile` protected?
     * Should I allow this request based on the token?

✅ That decision is made in `SecurityConfig`, specifically in:

```java
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()  // login/signup are open
    .anyRequest().authenticated()                 // everything else needs login
)
```

Without this, **Spring wouldn’t know which URLs need security** — even if you generated a token.

---

### 🛠️ Think of it like:

* **AuthService** is like giving a person a **key card** (JWT token).
* **SecurityConfig** sets the **rules for the building**:

  * 🔓 “Lobby (login/signup) is open to all”
  * 🔒 “Server room (protected routes) needs a key card”

---

### ✅ Summary:

* You're not repeating logic.
* You're **separating concerns**:

  * AuthController/AuthService → **create** tokens
  * SecurityConfig → **check** and **enforce** token rules

This is clean and follows best practices.

Let me know if you want to see what happens behind the scenes when a user sends a request with a token!
