Yes ‚Äî it looks like duplication, but it's intentional and necessary because:
üîê Spring Security and your custom JWT filter run separately:
SecurityConfig tells Spring Security:

"These endpoints are public. Don't block them if the user isn't authenticated."

But your custom JwtAuthenticationFilter needs to know:

"Should I try to validate the JWT token for this path or skip it?"

So your JWT filter needs to skip itself for public paths ‚Äî otherwise it will try
 to parse tokens unnecessarily (even when the request doesn't have or need one).

| Purpose                                  | Who uses it     | Why it's needed                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `permitAll()`                            | Spring Security | Decides whether to block a request if unauthenticated |
| `if(path.startsWith(...))` in JWT filter | Your code       | Decides whether to even bother checking the JWT       |



Q2.Why do we create a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken for every request, even though the user already has a JWT token?

You walk into a secure building with a digital ID (JWT)

Every time you enter a room, a security scanner reads your ID and gives you a temporary access badge (the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken)

Without the badge, the system doesn‚Äôt recognize you

So even if you show the ID, you won‚Äôt get in unless you get the badge for this room


| Step                                            | What Happens                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Client sends JWT                             | In the `Authorization` header                                          |
| 2. JWT filter decodes it                        | Extracts the user's identity                                           |
| 3. Create `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` | So Spring knows who the user is                                        |
| 4. Set in `SecurityContextHolder`               | So access to protected endpoints is allowed                            |
| ‚ùó Why every request?                            | Because server doesn't store sessions ‚Äî each request must prove itself |

Q3. what does this will do:filterChain.doFilter(request, response)??

It passes the request and response to the next filter in the Spring Security filter chain.

 Think of the filter chain like a conveyor belt:
Each request goes through multiple steps (filters) before it reaches your controller.

This line says:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done my job in this filter. Now pass the request to the next step.‚Äù

Q4. üõ°Ô∏è What is a JwtAuthenticationFilter?
A JwtAuthenticationFilter is a custom security filter in a Spring Boot application that:

‚úÖ Checks every incoming request to see if it has a valid JWT token.
‚úÖ If the token is valid, it authenticates the user.
‚úÖ If the token is missing or invalid, it just lets the request continue, and Spring Security will decide whether to allow or block it.

It runs before the request reaches your controller ‚Äî during the Spring Security filter chain.

Q5. Why are we passing the response object in filterChain.doFilter(request, response)?

The response object is a blank envelope. You pass it along the filter chain, and eventually:
The controller writes the actual message into it. Or Spring Security writes an error message into it.
Then it's sent back to the client.

Q/A 6.doFilterInternal() is called automatically by Spring Security. 

Q7.   What does OncePerRequestFilter do?
It's a Spring Security base class that:
Ensures your filter runs once per HTTP request


Q7. Flow charts: 


Awesome ‚Äî now you‚Äôre asking **how the login request flows**. Let‚Äôs walk through exactly what happens when someone tries to **log in** in a Spring Boot app using JWT authentication.

---

## ‚úÖ Scenario: A user logs in

Let‚Äôs say a frontend or Postman sends:

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

---

## üîÑ Flow: What happens next?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Request hits the Spring Security filter chain

Spring routes the request through all the filters ‚Äî including your `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.

But...

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Your `JwtAuthenticationFilter` **skips this request**

Why?

```java
if (path.startsWith("/api/auth/login")) {
    // Public path ‚Äî skip token check
    filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    return;
}
```

‚úîÔ∏è So the filter lets it go straight to the controller.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Controller handles the login

Your controller might look like this:

```java
@PostMapping("/login")
public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest request) {
    // 1. Authenticate email + password (via AuthenticationManager)
    // 2. If success, generate a JWT using JwtUtil
    // 3. Return the token to the client
}
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Spring Security‚Äôs `AuthenticationManager` does real authentication

Inside the controller or service, you usually call:

```java
authenticationManager.authenticate(
    new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(email, password)
);
```

‚úÖ This checks the credentials:

* Loads the user from DB using `UserDetailsService`
* Compares hashed password

If credentials are good:

* ‚úÖ It returns an `Authentication` object
* You generate a JWT token
* Send it back in the response

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ The response goes back to the client

Something like:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

---

## üß† Summary: Login flow

| Step | What happens                            | Who handles it                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | User sends `POST /api/auth/login`       | Frontend/Postman                       |
| 2    | Spring routes it through filters        | Spring Security                        |
| 3    | Your JWT filter skips login URL         | Your code in `JwtAuthenticationFilter` |
| 4    | Controller authenticates email/password | `AuthenticationManager`                |
| 5    | Token is generated and returned         | Your controller + `JwtUtil`            |

---

‚úÖ After this, the client stores the token and sends it in future requests as:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

And *that‚Äôs* when your `JwtAuthenticationFilter` will start **validating the token** on every request.

---

Q8. Flow charts continued: 

Excellent question! You're diving deeper into how Spring Security works ‚Äî let's walk through:

---

## üîí Where is the **Spring Security Filter Chain**?

### ‚û§ It‚Äôs not in *your* code directly.

It‚Äôs created **automatically by Spring Security** when your application starts.

---

### üîÅ What is it?

The **Spring Security Filter Chain** is a series of filters that process **every HTTP request**.
It decides:

* Is this request allowed?
* Is the user authenticated?
* Is the JWT token valid?
* Should access be denied?

---

## üîß Where is it configured?

You customize it using your own `SecurityConfig` class ‚Äî typically something like:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeHttpRequests()
            .requestMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

---

## üìç Key Points in This Code:

### üîπ `securityFilterChain(...)`

* You define the **rules**: which paths are public, which need login, etc.
* This method builds the actual filter chain Spring uses.

### üîπ `addFilterBefore(...)`

* Here you add your custom filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`) **before** the built-in `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.

That‚Äôs how your filter gets plugged into the chain.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Thing                         | Where It Comes From                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Spring Security Filter Chain  | Built by Spring when your app starts         |
| Your JwtAuthenticationFilter  | Added in your `SecurityConfig` class         |
| Who runs `doFilterInternal()` | Spring Security, as part of the filter chain |


Q/A 9. Here's the simple truth:
Whenever any HTTP request comes into your app, Spring Security‚Äôs filter chain runs first ‚Äî before your controller or any business logic.

Why?
Because Spring Security needs to:

Check if the request is authenticated

Validate tokens (like JWT)

Enforce access rules (who can access what)

Protect against attacks (CSRF, etc.)

Incoming Request
      ‚Üì
Spring Security Filter Chain (including your JwtAuthenticationFilter)
      ‚Üì
Controller (only if request passes security checks)
      ‚Üì
Response sent back to client

***Spring Security acts like a gatekeeper that inspects every request before letting it through.
